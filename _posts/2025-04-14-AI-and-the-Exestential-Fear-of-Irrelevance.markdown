Every time a new AI model is released, I feel a chill go down my spine as I wonder what skill I spent months learning has now become obsolete. This is likely a universal fear for anyone working in a field AI has threatened to replace - art, design, computer programming, writing, essentially anything enjoyable to do. It's concerning how fast AI is developing, how slowly human skills develop in comparison, and how efficient the overall system becomes in the process. It's as if humans are getting crushed out of the equation, with companies needing less and less people for the same jobs, removing entry level roles since AI is effectively the entry level help most companies need.

Of course, AI isn't massively different from the internet itself - it's effectively a much better search engine, with an added illusion of reasoning capabilities so that it can come up with more refined answers from its gargantuan database of knowledge. For instance, once I wanted to find a movie I watched when I was a kid. It was a Halloween themed movie which had a mean kid with blonde hair, a werewolf, a witch, and some other characters. If I put this into Google, I would never find it, and of course I didn't. When I asked Chat GPT and gave it the approximate year I would have watched it, it immediately guessed what movie I was looking for correctly - Scary Godmother: Halloween Spooktacular.
