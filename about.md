# About

Hi, I'm Vytis. I'm a physicist and data scientist with a diverse set of interests which I'm still trying to explore. I'm originally from Cypress, Texas but moved to New York City where I studied physics at Columbia University. Afterwards I moved back to Texas to study data science at the University of Texas at Austin.

I'm interested in a broad range of topics and love exploring new ideas, but I’ve been fortunate to know since I was seven that I wanted to study physics, so I’m pretty set on sticking with it. I worked on astrophysics research with professor Szabolcs Marka during my undergrad which introduced me to the value of computational skills and data science in scientific research. This motivated me to undertake a masters in the subject, which has been of unbelievable benefit to my research and vastly expanded my appreciation of computer sciences. I'm extremely excited about machine learning, AI, complex systems, and scientific research, especially how they all connect together and how I can combine them to develop cool projects. My research focuses on gamma ray bursts, gravitational wave sirens, and high THz photonics at the moment, but I've recently started working with a professor at the University of the West Indies where I hope to assist with agricultural research.

Outside of research I work on a company with a friend of mine from college, where I have developed and released two iOS apps and I'm working on two more. I'm most excited to work on cool projects that can be useful to people, so in this capacity I've dedicated a lot of time independently learning industry standard software tools and building a project from the ground up. I enjoy hiking, camping, drawing, art, literature, movies, and many other things. I enjoy art and art adjacent studies a lot, and love thinking and examining them in detail so I can better appreciate the world around me. One of my favorite quotes, from the Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill, is that "The only thing which makes life worth living is the enjoyment of beauty." - Autobiography (1873). All aspects of human creation, from math to architecture, to scultpure and science, should be equally respected and appreciated.

This site is a portfolio of the work I do and the questions I’m exploring — from software projects to theoretical deep dives. Feel free to explore or get in touch!
