# About

Hi, I'm Vytis. I'm a physicist and data scientist with a diverse set of interests which I'm still trying to explore. I'm originally from Cypress, Texas but moved to New York City where I studied physics at Columbia University. Afterwards I moved back to Texas to study data science at the University of Texas at Austin.
