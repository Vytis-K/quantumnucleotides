# Quantum Information Encoding in Nucleotides

![Quantum Nucleotide Concept](/assets/images/quantum-nucleotides.png)

A speculative project on the intersection of quantum computing, biology, and information theory.  
*(Started April 2025)*

---

## Overview

This project explores how nucleotide sequences might be used as substrates for quantum information encoding. Inspired by the idea that biological molecules can represent computational systems, the project considers how principles from quantum error correction and entanglement can be hypothetically mapped to DNA or RNA structures.

## Future Work

- Encoding schemes
- Quantum gate representations
- Simulation with toy models
